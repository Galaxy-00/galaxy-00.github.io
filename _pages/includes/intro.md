# ðŸ‘€ About Me

My name is Zhen Guo, and I am a third-year Masterâ€™s student in Electronic and Information Engineering at [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU)](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hongping Gan](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2020050020.html). I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from NPU in 2022.

During my master's studies, my work primarily involves developing deep unfolding networks to address inverse imaging problems, such as <strong>image compressive sensing</strong>, <strong>compressive sensing MRI</strong>, and <strong>snapshot compressive imaging</strong>.
I have contributed to several high-impact research projects and published papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including <strong>CVPR</strong> and <strong>IEEE TIP</strong>.
