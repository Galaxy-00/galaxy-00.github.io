# About me

My name is Zhen Guo, and I am a third-year Master’s student in Electronic and Information Engineering at [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU)](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hongping Gan](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2020050020.html). I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from NPU in 2022.

During my master's studies, my research interests include <strong>signal and image processing</strong>, <strong>inverse problems</strong>, and <strong>compressive sensing</strong>. 
My work primarily involves developing deep unfolding networks to address complex imaging challenges, such as <strong>image compressive sensing</strong>, <strong>compressive sensing MRI</strong>, and <strong>snapshot compressive imaging</strong>.
I have contributed to several high-impact research projects and published papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including <strong>CVPR</strong> and <strong>IEEE TIP</strong>.
